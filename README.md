# Java2DGame
My first 2D Java Game written in pure Java.


## About this project
This project is my first game written in pure Java. The reason why I chose not to use any library like Vulkan or OpenGL 
is because I would like to learn more about low-level graphics rendering.
<br />
_This project will be rebuild using Gradle in time_

## License
The project is inspired by the Java game development tutorial created by [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFYT7Lqt1h8&list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf). 
My contribution to it is based on modifying the original code and adding minor functionalities such as keyboard shortcuts.
<br />
However when I finish the tutorial, I will change this project to my own implementation of the same game. For now this repository is for progress tracking purposes only and
remains public to show the world that I'm currently doing something to develop my skills :smile:.
